                        <h4>Short biography</h4>
                        <p>
                            Born December 3, 1883 in Vienna, Anton Webern grew up in Vienna, Graz, and Klagenfurt as
                            well as at Preglhof, the family estate in Carinthia. He received his initial education in
                            music performance and theory in Klagenfurt where he also attended the
                            <em>Humanistische Gymnasium</em> (classical grammar school) and gained practical experience
                            as a cellist with the orchestra of the local Concert Society. In the autumn of 1902 Webern
                            began to study musicology at the Musicological Institute in Vienna under Guido Adler. He
                            graduated in 1906 with a dissertation on Heinrich Isaac’s <em>Choralis Constantinus</em>.
                            From 1904 to 1908 he studied composition with Arnold Schoenberg with whom he remained in
                            close contact throughout his life. Efforts to obtain a position as a permanent conductor in
                            various music theatres (Teplitz, Bad Ischl, Danzig, Stettin, Prague) ended in failure.<br />
                            After World War I, Webern taught music theory and composition to private students. He also
                            worked as a <em>Vortragsmeister</em> (rehearsal coach) for the Society for Private Musical
                            Performances (1918–1922), as a piano teacher and choirmaster at the Jewish Institute for the
                            Blind in Vienna (1925–1931) and, towards the end of his life, he accepted to arrange works
                            by other composers for Universal Edition.<br />
                            As a conductor of various choirs and orchestras (e.g. the Wiener Schubertbund, the Mödlinger
                            Männergesangverein, the Arbeiter-Symphoniekonzerte der Sozialdemokratischen Kunststelle in
                            Vienna), he became known to a wider public in the twenties and thirties. From 1927 onwards,
                            he worked as a conductor at the Viennese Radio where he was also employed as editor and
                            censor (1930–1939). On the national level, his activities as a conductor ceased after the
                            Dollfuß putsch in 1934. From 1929 onwards, a few international engagements took him several
                            times to London and Germany.<br />
                            The earliest documented examples of Webern’s compositional activity date from around 1900.
                            Before World War I, he first occupied himself with free, atonal compositions, then, in the
                            1920s he developed a specific, radically concentrated form of twelve-tone technique. His
                            oeuvre comprises 31 ‚Opuswerke‘, opus works, composed between 1908–1944 (mainly published by
                            Universal Edition, from op. 29 posthumously). It also includes arrangements of his own and
                            other composer’s works, as well as further compositions (partly published posthumously), and
                            drafts.<br />
                            Webern, his wife Wilhelmine (Minna), born Mörtl, who he married in February 1911, and their
                            four children Amalie, Maria, Peter and Christine lived mostly near Vienna, first in Mödling
                            and then later in Maria Enzersdorf where the Webern couple remained throughout the Second
                            World War. At the beginning of April 1945 they fled to Mittersill in Oberpinzgau, where, on
                            September 15, Anton Webern was shot dead by a soldier of the American occupation forces.
