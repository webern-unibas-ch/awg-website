            <div id="maintext">As a part of the complete edition of Anton Webern’s compositions, the Anton Webern
                Gesamtausgabe is compiling a full documentation of the composer’s biography, as well as of the genesis,
                publication and performance history of his works. To this end all types of data, including both tangible
                objects and intangible events, are archived and interrelated using the <a

                which gives both a general and a detailed description of Webern’s private as well as professional life
                and which also documents the development of his works, is substantiated by references to material
                evidence (e.g. correspondence, as archived and categorized under the heading <a

                composer's social environment.<br/><br/><br/><strong>Short biography<br/><br/></strong>Born December 3,
                1883 in Vienna, Anton Webern grew up in Vienna, Graz, and Klagenfurt as well as at Preglhof, the family
                estate in Carinthia. He received his initial education in music performance and theory in Klagenfurt
                where he also attended the <em>Humanistische Gymnasium</em> (classical grammar school) and gained
                practical experience as a cellist with the orchestra of the local Concert Society. In the autumn of 1902
                Webern began to study musicology at the Musicological Institute in Vienna under Guido Adler. He
                graduated in 1906 with a dissertation on Heinrich Isaac’s <em>Choralis Constantinus.</em> From 1904 to
                1908 he studied composition with Arnold Schoenberg with whom he remained in close contact throughout his
                life. Efforts to obtain a position as a permanent conductor in various music theatres (Teplitz, Bad
                Ischl, Danzig, Stettin, Prague) ended in failure. <br/>After World War I, Webern taught music theory and
                composition to private students. He also worked as a <em>Vortragsmeister </em>(rehearsal coach) for the
                Society for Private Musical Performances (1918–1922), as a piano teacher and choirmaster at the Jewish
                Institute for the Blind in Vienna (1925–1931) and, towards the end of his life, he accepted to arrange
                works by other composers for Universal Edition.<br/>As a conductor of various choirs and orchestras
                (e.g. the Wiener Schubertbund, the Mödlinger Männergesangverein, the Arbeiter-Symphoniekonzerte der
                Sozialdemokratischen Kunststelle in Vienna), he became known to a wider public in the twenties and
                thirties. From 1927 onwards, he worked as a conductor at the Viennese Radio where he was also employed
                as editor and censor (1930–1939). On the national level, his activities as a conductor ceased after the
                Dollfuß putsch in 1934. From 1929 onwards, a few international engagements took him several times to
                London and Germany.<br/>The earliest documented examples of Webern’s compositional activity date from
                around 1900. Before World War I, he first occupied himself with free, atonal compositions, then, in the
                1920s he developed a specific, radically concentrated form of twelve-tone technique. His oeuvre
                comprises 31 ‚Opuswerke‘, opus works, composed between 1908–1944 (mainly published by Universal Edition,
                from op. 29 posthumously). It also includes arrangements of his own and other composer’s works, as well
                as further compositions (partly published posthumously), and drafts.<br/>Webern, his wife Wilhelmine
                (Minna), born Mörtl, who he married in February 1911, and their four children Amalie, Maria, Peter and
                Christine lived mostly near Vienna, first in Mödling and then later in Maria Enzersdorf where the Webern
                couple remained throughout the Second World War. At the beginning of April 1945 they fled to Mittersill
                in Oberpinzgau, where, on September 15, Anton Webern was shot dead by a soldier of the American
                occupation forces.
